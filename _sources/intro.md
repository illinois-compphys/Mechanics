Classical mechanics explores the fundamental principles governing the motion of macroscopic objects and the forces that cause them. Here we will start exploring this using a computational approach. We'll learn how to translate theoretical concepts into working simulations, allowing us to visualize and analyze complex systems that are often more complicated to tackle with purely analytical methods.

We'll focus on using computational tools to investigate the dynamics of the Harmonic oscillators and planetary orbits. You'll gain hands-on experience in numerical integration, modeling, and analyzing your simulation output. We'll explore how to use programming to solve differential equations, visualize your results, and develop a deeper intuition for the physical world.
